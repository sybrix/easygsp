#summary Scope

= Scope =

There are 4 primary scopes in EasyGSP:  Flash, Request, Session and Application.  If your backgroup is java web development each of these work as you would expect.

== Flash ==

Variables set in flash scope have a life span of the request in which they are set, and one subsequent request.  This is useful for simple notifications and alerts, that need to exists even after a redirect request.

Flash scope can be accessed from any controller script or gsp/gspx template.  Its syntax for getting/setting values is the same as that of a java.util.Map.

Flash scope requires an active session.

Setting a flash scope variable
{{{
      flash.success = 'Your account was successfully created'
      flash['success message'] = 'This syntax works too'
      flash.put('anotherSuccessMessage', 'Event this works')

      redirect 'index.gspx'
}}}

The above variables will be available for the next request by the current user but will be not be available for any request after that.
