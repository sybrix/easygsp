#summary Creating an Application

= Creating an Application=


To create an application in EasyGSP, simply create a folder in the %EASYGSP_HOME%/webapps directory.  A folder in this directory represents an application. 

*web.groovy*
Each application can have a web.groovy file. Like servlet based applications, EasyGSP applications can have a WEB-INF directory.  Within this directory the web.groovy file resides.

This file can have the following methods

||Method||Description||
||onApplicationStart||Invoked when the application is initially started and on the first request after the file has been altered.  
||onApplicationEnd || Invoked when the server is shutdown. 
||onSessionStart || Invoked immediately after a session is created
||onSessionEnd|| Invoked when a session expires, is invalidated or when an application is restarted.
