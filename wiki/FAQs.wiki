*How do I add jars to my application ?*

*You can not add jars at the application level*. You can add additional jars for ALL applications by placing jars in the `$EASYGSP_HOME/lib` folder.  Again, these jars will be available to ALL applications.    EasyGSP applications don't have a context/WEB-INF/lib folder like servlet based web applications.  

* Where can I host my EasyGSP application  ?*

Probably nowhere unless you're willing to pay for your own server.  Since I do recognize this as a problem, an ironic problem since easyGSP is trying to solve this very problem, contact me and if you've developed something in EasyGSP and now want a place to host it.  I can provide a certain amount of *absolutely no guarantee of anything* free hosting for hardcore groovy developers.

* Are taglibs supported ?*
No.  At this time they are not.  If a case can be made the benefits of taglibs outweigh the cost of developing them and offer something significantly more useful than the include directive, then I would be willing to developing the feature.  Currently, I don't see the need, but this could change.
