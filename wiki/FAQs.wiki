*How do I add jars to my application ?*

*You can not add jars at the application level*. You can add additional jars for ALL applications by placing jars in the `$EASYGSP_HOME/lib` folder.  Again, these jars will be available to ALL applications.    EasyGSP applications don't have a context/WEB-INF/lib folder like serlvet based web applications.
