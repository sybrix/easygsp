#summary EasyOM Transactions

= Transactions=

EasyOM allows for transactions via it's withTransaction method.  This method accepts a closure and any EasyOM queries run within the closure are included in the transaction.  If any exception occurs, all DML statements are rolled back.


{{{
     import static util.EasyOM.*
     
     // assume User and Address are EasyOM enabled objects
     def saveUser(){
           def user = new User([firstName:'Brian', lastName:'Jermaine'])
           def address = new Address([address:'PO Box 100',city:'Quincy', state:'FL'])

           withTransaction{
               user.save()
               address.save() 
           }
     }

}}}

The withTransaction was made available via the static import.  Otherwise, it would have been `EasyOM.withTransaction{}`
