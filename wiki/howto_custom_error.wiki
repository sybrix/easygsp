#summary Custom Error Page.

= Custom Error Pag =

Each application can have it's own custom error pages.  A custom error page must be located in the WEB-INF/errors directory.  The naming convention is "error" + ErrorCode + ".gsp.  So a custom 404 error code page would be named:  error404.gsp .


{{{
   +-- AppFolder
        |
        +-- WEB-INF
             |
             +-- errors
                  |
                  |--error500.gsp
                  |--error404.gsp          
}}

If no custom pages are found, the servers error pages are used. They are located at $EASYGSP_HOME/conf/errors.
