#summary Logging

= Logging =

Every class, controller and template can call the follow methods:
|| *Object* || *Description* ||
|| void console(Object object) || Writes object.toString() to the console/terminal window. Useful when developing ||
|| void log(String s)|| Writes message to application's log file.  Log file located @ WEB-INF/logs. Messages are written to the log file at a specified interval, not immediately. ||
|| void log(Throwable t)|| Writes exception to application's log file.  Log file located @ WEB-INF/logs ||
|| void log(String logMessage, Throwable t) || Writes message and exception to log file. Log file located @ WEB-INF/logs ||

==== void console(Object message) =====
If you start EasyGSP in a terminal window, and you want to write something out to the console, use the console() method.  

console() == System.out.println()

and System.out.println will still work, take your pick.
If you use simply, println(), this will write to the response.outputstream, not to the console window.

==== log() =====
The log methods write to a log file on the file system.  When an applications, if a WEB-INF folder does not exist one is created. When a log statement is invoked, if a logs directory does not exist under the WEB-INF folder one is created.
