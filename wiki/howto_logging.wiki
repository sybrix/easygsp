#summary Logging

= Logging =

Every class, controller and template can call the follow methods:
|| *Object* || *Description* ||
|| void console(Object object) || Writes object.toString() to the console/terminal window. Useful when developing ||
|| void log(String s)|| Writes message to application's log file.  Log file located @ WEB-INF/logs. Messages are written to the log file at a specified interval, not immediately. ||
|| void log(Throwable t)|| Writes exception to application's log file.  Log file located @ WEB-INF/logs ||
|| void log(String logMessage, Throwable t) || Writes message and exception to log file. Log file located @ WEB-INF/logs ||

==== void console(Object message) =====
If you start EasyGSP in a terminal window, and you want to write something out to the console, use the console() method.  

console() == System.out.println()

But System.out.println will still work.
